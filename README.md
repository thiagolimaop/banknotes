## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
 
The necessary libraries to run the code in Python version 3.*:
- Anaconda (Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Datetime)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
Finest banks are working on introducing security features to banknotes. Ultraviolet and holographic features, watermarks, and metal threads, but forgeries are explored in modern technology to recreate these features, even watermarks. The core of this project would be a machine learning to make predictions about genuine and forged banknotes.

## File Description<a name="files"></a>
- <b>Final project.ipynb</b>: a notebook containing all the processes to build a unsupervised model to predict genuine and forged banknotes.
- <b>Banknote-authentication-dataset.csv</b>: the dataset used with the two features (variance and skewness) and no target.
- <b>bank_notes_results.csv</b>: the original dataset from OpenML with the four features (variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy) and the target .
- <b>Final project.html</b>: an HTML version of the notebook
